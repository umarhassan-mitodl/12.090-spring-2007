Description
-----------

This course covers the following topics: Production and movement of surficial materials; soils and soil erosion; precipitation; streams and lakes; groundwater flow; glaciers and their deposits. The course combines aspects of geology, climatology, hydrology, and soil science to present a coherent introduction to the surface of the Earth, with emphasis on both fundamental concepts and practical applications, as a basis for understanding and intelligent management of the Earth's physical and chemical environment.

Exams
-----

There are mid-term exam and final exam. Both exams are in class close book exams. Mid-term exam is optional.

Grading
-------

If a student receives better grade in final exam than in mid-term exam, then final exam counts for 100% of the grade. If a student receives better grade in mid-term exam than in final exam, then mid-term exam counts for 1/3 of the grade and final exam counts for 2/3 of the grade.
